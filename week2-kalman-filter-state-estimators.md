# Motivation

While recursive least squares updates the estimate of a static parameter,  the Kalman filter is able to *update* and *estimate* of an evolving state 

# Notation

# (Linear) Kalman Filter

The linear KF is a recursive LS estimators that also includes **a motion model**

(1) prediction/estimate (2) correction/update
